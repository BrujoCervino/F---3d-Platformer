# F ~ 3d Platformer
 
 Run, jump and shrink your way through the world of F (working title)!


# Brief summary:
 
 Language(s):  C++ (& Unreal Blueprint scripting)
 Software:     Unreal Engine 4, Visual Studio
 Platform:     Windows 10
 

# Description:

I began this project in Blueprint, and am porting it to C++. 

+ The code looks little in quantity because it mostly currently exists in the form of Blueprints. 
+ The original prototype took 2-3 days to develop: the level design took the longest (as I don't design levels often).
+ The core game loop was very quick to implement: collect however many cells to reach the next level.
+ Most of the work has consisted of polishing the mechanics (making and implementing sounds, screenshake, 
  controller vibrations and barebones graphics).
